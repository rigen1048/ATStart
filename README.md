# ATStart
A Chrome extension.

# What it solves
It solves a hyper-niche pain point with the browsers.
Start up tabs.

It's either completely blank or becomes bloated really fast due to opening the last session.

Wouldn't it be nice if a browser always opened up tabs that you always start your day with and allowed you to close them?
That's what it solves.
It's so niche I wasn't even bothered to polish this project.

# How to use it?
1. Clone it / Download the zip
2. Go to background.js, add the links you want, like gmail.com or whatever
3. Go to a Chrome-based browser, like Chrome, Brave, or any other
4. Go to extension
5. Enable the developer to move
6. Click load unpacked
7. Select this folder

# Note:
Everytime You update the link, make sure to go to the extension page in your browser and reload it.

# Contribution:
- You can add a feature where the user can dynamically add links
- You can gimme a copyright-free logo
